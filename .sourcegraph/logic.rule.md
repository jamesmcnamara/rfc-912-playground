Check for logical mistakes or inverted conditions:

- Look for off-by-one errors, copy-pasted code that didn't get updated, or other obvious product/feature bugs.
- Call out debugging print statements that are not removed.
- Identify any suspicious conditionals that seem inverted or contradictory
- Look for arguments that are passed in the wrong order.

Any logic errors should be considered an ERROR
